# Project Brief: puppet-znapzend

**This file is maintained manually by the developer. Do not edit this file directly - suggest updates to the user.**

## Core Purpose
Puppet module for managing znapzend, a ZFS snapshot backup and replication daemon that automates ZFS backup operations across multiple Unix-like systems.

## Primary Goals
1. **Complete znapzend Lifecycle Management**: Install, configure, and manage the znapzend service across RedHat/CentOS, FreeBSD, and Solaris systems
2. **Flexible Backup Plan Configuration**: Enable declarative definition of ZFS backup plans with local and remote destinations
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support different init systems (systemd, rc.d, SMF) and OS-specific paths/behaviors
4. **Security and User Management**: Handle dedicated backup users, sudo privileges, and secure ZFS operations
5. **Production-Ready Operations**: Provide reliable service management with proper logging, PID management, and configuration reloading

## Target Systems
- RedHat/CentOS (systemd)
- FreeBSD (rc.d)
- Solaris (SMF - Service Management Facility)

## Key Requirements
- ZFS filesystem support on target systems
- SSH passwordless authentication for remote backups
- Optional mbuffer support for improved transfer performance
- Proper privilege escalation for ZFS operations

## Success Criteria
- Automated znapzend installation and service startup
- Declarative backup plan configuration through Puppet manifests
- Reliable snapshot creation and replication to configured destinations
- Comprehensive test coverage for all supported platforms
